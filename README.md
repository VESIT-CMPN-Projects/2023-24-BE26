India's rapid urbanization demands innovative solutions to address energy consumption patterns while reducing reliance on fossil fuels. This research paper explores the application of predictive modeling techniques like Multilayer Perceptron and Linear Regression to forecast solar energy generation and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to forecast wind energy generation, thereby facilitating efficient energy planning in major Indian cities. The LSTM model obtained a MAPE of 0.4615 and the linear regression model obtained a negative MSE of -3296.167. The proposed system aims to create a web-based platform that integrates these predictive models to display real-time temperature conditions and the corresponding amount of energy that solar and wind sources can provide in specific locations, thus promoting smart cities and smart homes. By utilizing the website, energy planners will be able to compare the generated energy from wind and solar sources, enabling informed decisions on which resource best meets the energy requirements of housing settlements.
